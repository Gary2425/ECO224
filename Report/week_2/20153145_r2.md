## 1.	What’s the research question of the paper?
The paper seeks to explain the estimation an inference methods for high-dimensional sparse (HDS) regression models in econometrics. The question this paper wants to answer is the following: “In a context of high-dimensional sparsity, which are the the most appropriate HDS methods for certain modelling contexts (presented in the paper)?”
## 2.	Which are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper’s approach to answer such question?
The are 02 main strengths of the paper, all of them regarding its explanatory power due to its analytical approach.
The first is its organized structure in which separates models and estimation methods. This allows to estimate different models with different estimation methods —with penalizations of taxi-cab metric—, thus giving a comparation between them in terms of the applicability of each method  according to the specific analytics context and model and structure
The second strength of the paper is its inclusion of empirical examples for the distinct models and lasso methods presented throughout the paper.
I can’t mention any weakness for the fact that I have barely understood the paper in detail.
## 3.	What’s the contribution of this paper towards the construction of a proper answer to the question? 
Describing explicitly what the first strength mentioned in the former point above, this paper enhances the comprehension of the applicability of lasso methods by analyzing how they perform in the instrumental variable (IV) model and the partially linear model, both of which are widely used to estimate structural economic effects.
## 4.	Which would be one or two following significant step(s) in order to keep developing an answer to the research question?

The next step is to expand the analysis beyond lasso methods (with the taxi-cab penalization) and to revise other contributions regarding structural economic objects.
